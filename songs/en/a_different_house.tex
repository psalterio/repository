% section #1: verse 

\beginverse

There’s a \[D]lighthouse on the hillside \[D7]that \[G]overlooks the \[D]sea
When I’m tossed it sends out a lig\[E9/B]ht tha\[E7]t I might \[A]see.
\[A7]And the \[D]light that shines in \[D7]darkness, now wi\[Em7]ll safely lead us \[E7]o’er:
\[A7]If it w\[D]asn’t for the lighthouse\[D7 G], my ship would \[G/A A7 D]be no more.

\endverse

% section #2: chorus 

\beginchorus

And I thank\[D] God \[A7]for the \[G/D]ligh\[D]thouse\[D9G]! I owe my life \[Gm6 D]to Him.
For Jesus \[A7]is the \[G/D D]lighthouse, and \[E9]from \[E7]the rocks of \[A]sin.
\[D]He has shone a \[A7]light \[G/D]around \[D]me \[D9]that I\[G] could clea\[Gm6 D]rly see:
If it \[D]wasn’t for the lighthouse\[A7], where would this sh\[D]ip be?

\endchorus

%----------------------------------------------------------
% section #3: verse 

\beginverse

Ev’ry\[D]body that lives about us \[D7]says, “\[G]Tear that lighthouse \[D]down
The big ships don’t sail this way \[E9/B]anymore, \[E7]There’s no use of it standing \[A]‘round”.
\[A7]Then my \[D]mind goes back to that \[D7]stormy night when just \[Em7]in time I saw the \[E7]light:
\[A7]Yes, the \[D]light from that old lighthouse \[D7 G] that stands up there on [G/A A7 D]the hill.

\endverse
